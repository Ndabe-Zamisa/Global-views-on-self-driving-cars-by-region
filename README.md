# Global Views on Self-Driving Cars by Region

Welcome to the "Global Views on Self-Driving Cars by Region" project. This README provides an overview of the project's purpose and structure, along with the SQL queries used to extract insights from the dataset.

## Project Overview

The "Global Views on Self-Driving Cars by Region" project is a database management system built using Microsoft SQL Server. It serves as a repository for data related to public opinions on self-driving cars, categorized by different regions. The dataset includes information about respondents' feelings of safety, uncertainties, and refusals concerning self-driving cars.

## Database Structure

The core of this project is a SQL table named `[Global views on self-driving cars by region]`. This table holds the dataset and consists of several columns:

- `Region`: Represents the region from which the survey responses were collected.
- `Yes, would feel safe`: Indicates the number of respondents who feel safe using self-driving cars.
- `No, would not feel safe`: Reflects the number of respondents who do not feel safe using self-driving cars.
- `Don't know - self-driving cars question`: Contains data on the number of respondents who express uncertainty about self-driving cars.
- `Refused - self-driving cars question`: Contains data on the number of respondents who refused to answer questions about self-driving cars.

## SQL Queries

The project uses SQL queries to extract valuable insights from the dataset. These queries help answer specific questions about the dataset. The queries are executed to identify regions with various respondent sentiments regarding self-driving cars, including feeling safe, feeling unsafe, being uncertain, or refusing to answer.

For the SQL queries and their specific purposes, please refer to the project documentation or data analysis section.
